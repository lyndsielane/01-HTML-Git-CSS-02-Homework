# Homework 01-HTML-Git-CSS

## Initial Findings

The Website looks clear and functional. The Search Engine Optimization header tab doesn't lead anywhere, but that is the only issue I can find.
The HTML code seems pretty straightforward and clean. The CSS file is pretty long, so I want to see if there is some possible clean up I can do there. The main goal is to add several accessibility features to the website for the client. I will begin with an initial brush through to see if there is any way we can clean it a bit before working on the accessibility checklist.  

## Changes
* HTML - Updated the Title in the meta data to reflect the company name instead of 'website'
* HTML - Changed the div for the main header to a header
* HTML - Added an matching ID to the image to enable the Search Engine Optimization header to link to that portion of the webpage
* Changed the section names to make the names more indicative of the contents - updated the CSS names to match
* Applied sections and asides to remove the duplicated classes and CSS portions - updated CSS and HTML to match
* Rearranged the CSS blocks for better readability
* Added notes in the HTML code to further indicate the main pieces of content within the code
* Added "Alt" tags to the pictures
